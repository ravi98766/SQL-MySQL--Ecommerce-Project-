***1.	Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly 
trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?*** 

```bash
SELECT
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(website_sessions.created_at) AS mo, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS conv_rate
FROM website_sessions
	LEFT JOIN orders 
		ON orders.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27'
	AND website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

***2.	Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.***

```bash
SELECT
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(website_sessions.created_at) AS mo, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_orders
FROM website_sessions
	LEFT JOIN orders 
		ON orders.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27'
	AND website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

***3.	While we’re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type? 
I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.*** 

```bash
SELECT
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(website_sessions.created_at) AS mo, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_orders
FROM website_sessions
	LEFT JOIN orders 
		ON orders.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27'
	AND website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
    AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

<img width="547" height="251" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364a8470-f151-4c5d-af25-79915b09c9a0" />


***4.	I’m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from Gsearch. 
Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?***
```bash
***first, finding the various utm sources and referers to see the traffic we're getting***

```bash
SELECT DISTINCT 
	utm_source,
    utm_campaign, 
    http_referer
FROM website_sessions
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27';
```

<img width="541" height="419" alt="41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed35d9df-fbca-4b98-8e36-46418bed9204" />

```bash
SELECT
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(website_sessions.created_at) AS mo, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS gsearch_paid_sessions,

FROM website_sessions
	LEFT JOIN orders 
		ON orders.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

***5.	I’d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. 
Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?*** 

```bash
SELECT
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(website_sessions.created_at) AS mo, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS conversion_rate    
FROM website_sessions
	LEFT JOIN orders 
		ON orders.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
 
<img width="384" height="212" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f299081-db5c-4194-9ca7-4911146973ae" />


***6.	For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us (Hint: Look at the increase in CVR from the test (Jun 19 – Jul 28), and use 
nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)***

```bash
SELECT
	MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_test_pv
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = '/lander-1';
```

<img width="413" height="223" alt="61" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0363b803-0fcd-449e-9a65-6dded31a2d5a" />


***for this step, we'll find the first pageview id*** 

```bash
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_test_pageviews
SELECT
	website_pageviews.website_session_id, 
    MIN(website_pageviews.website_pageview_id) AS min_pageview_id
FROM website_pageviews 
	INNER JOIN website_sessions 
		ON website_sessions.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
		AND website_sessions.created_at < '2012-07-28' -- prescribed by the assignment
		AND website_pageviews.website_pageview_id >= 23504 -- first page_view
        AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
        AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY 
	website_pageviews.website_session_id;
```

```bash
SELECT * FROM first_test_pageviews;
```

<img width="259" height="261" alt="62" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fcb9251-7dd0-47de-b535-b354e0d4d7f9" />
 

***next, we'll bring in the landing page to each session, like last time, but restricting to home or lander-1 this time***

```bash
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE nonbrand_test_sessions_w_landing_pages
SELECT 
	first_test_pageviews.website_session_id, 
    website_pageviews.pageview_url AS landing_page
FROM first_test_pageviews
	LEFT JOIN website_pageviews 
		ON website_pageviews.website_pageview_id = first_test_pageviews.min_pageview_id
WHERE website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/home','/lander-1');
```

```bash
SELECT * FROM nonbrand_test_sessions_w_landing_pages;
```
 
<img width="251" height="293" alt="63" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7c5affd-b7d3-4cf2-91d1-4cd2e11f9082" />


***then we make a table to bring in orders***

```bash
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE nonbrand_test_sessions_w_orders
SELECT
	nonbrand_test_sessions_w_landing_pages.website_session_id, 
    nonbrand_test_sessions_w_landing_pages.landing_page, 
    orders.order_id AS order_id

FROM nonbrand_test_sessions_w_landing_pages
LEFT JOIN orders 
	ON orders.website_session_id = nonbrand_test_sessions_w_landing_pages.website_session_id
;
```
```bash
SELECT * FROM nonbrand_test_sessions_w_orders;
```

***to find the difference between conversion rates*** 

```bash
SELECT
	landing_page, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS conv_rate
FROM nonbrand_test_sessions_w_orders
GROUP BY 1;
```

<img width="295" height="70" alt="65" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd36071b-9aa1-4de5-8a29-f7fae6827aca" />

 ```bash
***.0319 for /home, vs .0406 for /lander-1***
***.0087 additional orders per session***
```

***finding the most recent pageview for gsearch nonbrand where the traffic was sent to /home***

```bash
SELECT 
	MAX(website_sessions.website_session_id) AS most_recent_gsearch_nonbrand_home_pageview 
FROM website_sessions 
	LEFT JOIN website_pageviews 
		ON website_pageviews.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE utm_source = 'gsearch'
	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
    AND pageview_url = '/home'
    AND website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27'
;
```
 
***max website_session_id = 17145***

<img width="285" height="70" alt="66" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c19de96f-c599-4370-869e-f6df6e09473e" />

	AND website_session_id > 17145 -- last /home session
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
;
```

***22,972 website sessions since the test***

***22,972 X .0087 incremental conversion = 202 incremental orders since 7/29***
***roughly 4 months, so roughly 50 extra orders per month. Not bad!***

    

***7.	For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel  from each of the two pages to orders. 
You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 – Jul 28).***

***1. First, I’d like to show our volume growth. Can you pull overall session and order volume, 
trended by quarter for the life of the business? Since the most recent quarter is incomplete, 
you can decide how to handle it.***

***5. We’ve come a long way since the days of selling a single product. Let’s pull monthly trending for revenue  and margin by product, along with total sales and revenue. Note anything you notice about seasonality.***
 

```bash
SELECT
	YEAR(created_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(created_at) AS mo, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price_usd ELSE NULL END) AS mrfuzzy_rev,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price_usd - cogs_usd ELSE NULL END) AS mrfuzzy_marg,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 2 THEN price_usd ELSE NULL END) AS lovebear_rev,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 2 THEN price_usd - cogs_usd ELSE NULL END) AS lovebear_marg,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 3 THEN price_usd ELSE NULL END) AS birthdaybear_rev,

***6. Let’s dive deeper into the impact of introducing new products. Please pull monthly sessions to 
the /products page, and show how the % of those sessions clicking through another page has changed 
over time, along with a view of how conversion from /products to placing an order has improved.***
 

***-- first, identifying all the views of the /products page***
```bash
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE products_pageviews
SELECT
	website_session_id, 
    website_pageview_id, 
    created_at AS saw_product_page_at

FROM website_pageviews 
WHERE pageview_url = '/products'
;
 ```

***7. We made our 4th product available as a primary product on December 05, 2014 (it was previously only a cross-sell item). 
Could you please pull sales data since then, and show how well each product cross-sells from one another?***
 
```bash
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE primary_products

	order_id, 
    primary_product_id, 
    created_at AS ordered_at
